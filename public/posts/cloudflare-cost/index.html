<p>In a new acquirer, engineering efforts should without question be invested in adding value for merchants and PSPs, instead of coding Visa protocol messages.</p>
<p>For processing payments, the right choice is rely on a dedicated payment processor (such as

<p>Simplified formula % of tx amount minus card processor costs minus platform costs.</p>
