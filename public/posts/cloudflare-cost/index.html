<p>In a new acquirer, engineering efforts should without question be invested in adding value for merchants and PSPs, instead of coding Visa protocol messages.</p>
<p>For processing payments, the right choice is rely on a dedicated payment processor (such as

<a href="https://www.silverflow.co" target="_blank">Silverflow</a>

) - a partner that is fully dedicated on scheme protocols with a business model based on number of transactions and not the monetary volume.</p>
<h4 id="unit-economics-of-anacquirer">Unit economics of anÂ acquirer</h4>

<p>


<p>With a IC++ merchant pricing model acquiring revenue is always a direct % of the payment amount - it is unaffected by interchange or scheme fees which are passed on to the merchant.

<p>


Compared to a blended pricing model, IC++ makes it much easier to project the estimated earnings on the monthly or yearly volume the merchant is expecting.</p>
<p>But regardless of the pricing, goal is to keep the platform costs as lower per tx as possible.
Cloudflare Workers

 in that respect beats GCP or AWS.</p>
