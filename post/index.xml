      <description>The great Retrofit library by Square has by now become an industry standard. Here is little scratch beneath the surface to understand some of its design decisions.

      <description>At 2AM on a cold Saturday night I was standing on the upper level of a nightclub, observing the party below. The dance floor has gone wild and the bar is crowded. Behind the bar, couple of waiters were running wild trying to keep up with the orders. And they were doing a damn good job. I wondered how long it would take for me to get this good. The POS software they used was the most popular POS in Adriatic nightclubs and restaurants.</description>

      <description>Having worked with card payment solutions, I formed a habit of noticing the POS hardware when waiting in line at the register.
Konzum (largest supermarket chain in Croatia) and IKEA Zagreb both use the same POS terminal made by the French company Ingenico. Terminal is also supplied with an optional PIN privacy shield to provide the customer with additional confidentiality.
Unlike Konzum, IKEA decided to buy the optional shield.
 This might not seem like a big deal, but card frauds don&amp;rsquo;t just happen to people you read about, they are real.</description>

      <description>At quarter past eleven on a Wednesday night we learned that one of our customers had run into a problem. We decided not to wait solving it. Few minutes later, as I was leaving my apartment, I decided to use a popular app to get myself a taxi. As I walked down the staircase from the top floor of my building I got the notification - a car was on its way.</description>
